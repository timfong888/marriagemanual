Why isn't there a manual for men before they go into marriage?

We have one for cars.  There's a driving test and a license before you can get behind the wheel.

The idea is that, without such training, you could hurt yourself or someone else.

Couldn't the same be said about marriage?

Not that most men event want to go to therapy in the first place.

But, even if you did or felt that it was something to consider, it could actually make things much worse.
