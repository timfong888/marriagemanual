Why isn't there a manual for men before they go into marriage?

We have one for cars.  There's a driving test and a license before you can get behind the wheel.

The idea is that, without such training, you could hurt yourself or someone else.

Couldn't the same be said about marriage?

I am serious.  Before you toss this, however, ask yourself whether you relate.

Like a manual, this is designed to give you a path on how you, the man, can understand the underlying mechanics of a relationship.
